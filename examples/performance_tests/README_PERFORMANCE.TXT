The sub-directories are programs to capture performance data on the various GNU Radio filter blocks and the FPGA accelerated FIR filter block.
The Makefiles assume that GNU Radio is installed in /opt/gnuradio/. If this is different, simply change the INCLUDE and LIBS lines to the correct directory.

Please note: The included GNU Radio filter files in the sub-directories may be out of date.
